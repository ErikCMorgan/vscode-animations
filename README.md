## Relationship to Blur Menu Extension

This extension is a focused spinoff from the [Blur Menu Extension](https://github.com/amnweb/blur-menu-vscode), originally created by amnweb. While Blur Menu offers a comprehensive set of UI enhancements including blur effects, this extension focuses solely on providing smooth animations to VSCode UI elements.

We appreciate the work done in the original Blur Menu extension and have built upon that foundation to create this specialized animation tool. If you're looking for the full feature set including blur effects, please check out the original Blur Menu extension.
